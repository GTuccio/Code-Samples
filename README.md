# Code-Samples
Miscellaneous Code Samples

In this repo are demonstrations of interesting coding examples using C#, VB, JS, .NET and SQL. 
I made up the example to show the code. Please take the underlying sample concept with a grain of salt. You might also say there's a shorter way to do it. There may well be. 
I'm simply experimenting with the constructs.
